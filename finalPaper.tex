%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
% Problem, gap, approach, key results
   The ``M5 Forecasting - Accuracy: Estimate the unit sales of Walmart retail
   goods'' competition (will be referred as the ``M5 Forecasting Competition''
   and ``The Competition'') challenged Kaggle users to design a learning model
   that would be able to predict how many of a certain item would be sold
   on a given day. In this paper we embark in the challenge to create such a
   model and improve on current strategies.

\section{Introduction}
% Broad problem and impact
% scientific gap(what technical aspects have not yet been solved)
% summary approach (should include reference to technical gap)
% key results

The introduction goes here.

\verb'\cvprfinalcopy' Is for different font

An example of a bad paper:
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
    An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
\end{center}

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of our
   previous paper [1], and show it to be inferior to all
   previously known methods.  Why the previous paper was
   accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

   [1] Removed for blind review

This is how you cite a reference submission~\cite{Authors06} as additional material and

\begin{quote}
and this is a quote and a another special formatting {\tt eccv06.pdf}.

the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

FAQ: Are acknowledgements OK?  No.  Leave them for the final copy.

\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
\verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)

For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors06} to
\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors06}.

Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like.  It
often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
